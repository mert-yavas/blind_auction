# Blind Auction Program
# Overview
Hello! I'm Mert, and today is Day 9 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. I'm excited to share my latest project: a Blind Auction program. This Python script simulates a blind auction where participants can place their bids without knowing the others' offers.

# How It Works
The Blind Auction program operates in a straightforward manner:

1. Enter Bids: Participants enter their names and bid amounts.
2. Repeat Process: The program asks if there are any more bidders, allowing multiple participants to enter their bids.
3. Find Highest Bid: Once all bids are entered, the program identifies the highest bid.
4. Announce Winner: The winner, along with their bid amount, is announced at the end.
# Features
* Multiple Bidders: Supports an unlimited number of bidders in each auction.
* Privacy of Bids: Ensures that each participant's bid is kept private until the end of the auction.
* Dynamic Bidding: Participants can enter any bid amount.
* Clear Winner Announcement: Clearly announces the winner and their bid amount.
* User-Friendly Interface: Simple input prompts make it easy for anyone to participate.

# Required Libraries and Files
To run this program, the following is required:

* replit: A library used for clearing the console screen, which helps maintain a clean interface for each new bidder. Install it via pip using pip install replit.
* art.py: This file is included in the repository. It provides ASCII art, such as logos, to enhance the user interface and the program's visual appeal.
  
# User Guide
Participate in the Blind Auction by following these steps:

1. Start the program.
2. Enter your name and bid when prompted.
3. Indicate whether more bidders are present.
4. Repeat until all bids are placed.
5. View the announcement of the highest bidder and their bid.
# Conclusion
Have fun participating in or simulating your own blind auctions! This program is a great way to understand the dynamics of bidding and auctioning in a simple and interactive manner. Enjoy the thrill of bidding and the suspense of waiting for the winner's reveal!
